    "Drivers decide when to claim a trip. Their decision depends on several factors, but the trip fare is the most important. HopSkipDrive (HSD) cannot control some of the trip's characteristics but can control the base trip fare and the subsequent boosts. If the only objective were for HSD to get rides claimed earlier, the solution would be to find the optimal boost that minimizes the time between trips being created and those claimed, given some constraints such as budget. Let's call this function f(x). However, HSD not only cares about this single objective optimization because it also cares about reducing the average cost of rides, leading to this assignment's second research question.   "

    "In practice, HSD is interested in a bi-objective optimization: min(f(x), g(x)) given some constraints. There is a natural trade-off between f(x) and g(x), and the set of optimal solutions would help HSD decide which trade-off works better for its business objective. We could use operations research methods to answer the question directly to find optimal solutions where neither f(x) nor g(x) can be further optimized. However, my perspective on this assignment as a data scientist is not to calculate the set of optimal solutions. Instead, I will analyze the boost data to understand the factors that lead drivers to expect higher boost amounts."

    "The core of my proposal lies in personalization. HSD runs a unique marketplace where it guarantees to meet the demand side of the business. However, drivers decide when to claim a trip. There are segments of drivers with different levels of sensitivity to boost amounts. A machine learning model would allow HSD to find those segments and score them by their likelihood of accepting distinct amounts of boosts. HSD could use those scores in a production model to roll out boosts by segments, starting with the segments that are more likely to accept smaller amounts of boosts. However, the data provided for this assignment does not include driver-specific information. Therefore, I built a toy model of a modified version of my proposal for this assignment: an Elastic Net regression that models the percentage increase in base fare as the dependent variable among trips that received a boost to measure the factors that lead drivers to expect a higher boost amount.

    "- A few recommendations based on the results of the model:\n",
    "    - Month seasonality is strongly positively related to an expected increase in the base fare amount. I recommend offering minor boosts during the months when drivers' expectations for significant boosts are lower. I'm not saying what specific months because I engineered month seasonality with sine and cosine transformations and decided not to back-engineer them to actual months to have time to finish the assignment. \n",
    "    - Offer lower boosts in metro areas where the expectation for high boosts is lower, such as DFW or Greensboro. Similarly, markets like DMV and Sacramento expect higher boosts. \n",
    "    - Trips that start at peak hours expect higher boosts. When calculating the base fare of peak-hours trips, consider the trip will likely need a boost. \n",
    "    - Drivers like longer trips, so consider that drivers have a lower expectation for larger boosts when the trip is longer in distance and in time."

    "    - Invest in acquiring more drivers. From an economic perspective, a larger supply should drive prices down.\n",

I would also modularize the Python model pipeline to align with best practices in reproducibility and MLOps. I would use MLFlow (it even has an integration with SageMaker) for MLOps. I would also dockerize the model to prepare and hand it off to the DevOps team. All these processes vary across companies' needs and resources.

    "* HSD guarantees the rides, so once they are scheduled, HSD needs to make sure they are claimed as soon as possible at the lowest price possible.\n",
    "* I assume HSD has a pricing system that outputs the optimal pricing for each `trip_id`. Therefore, I will assume that if a trip was claimed without a boost, the dollar amount paid to the driver is the optimal price per trip. I will call that fare the `base_fare`. For trips that received a boost, `base_fare` would be `dollars_paid_to_driver` minus the sum of all the boosts that trip received. This assumes that `dollars_paid_to_driver` is the total final amount of dollars paid to a driver, including any boosts. \n",
    "* I will also define a column called `boost_prop_base_fare` to represent the percentage of the optimal price that the trip had to be boosted to claim. "

    "* By fitting a linear model, we could further condition the expected value to see if the expectation changes based on covariate values. That would give us additional information about the covariates that increase or decrease the sensitivity to price changes. \n",
    "* I will build another toy model to explore this idea in the next section.\n",
    "* However, at this point of the analysis, I think it is worth noting that ideally, I would like to measure the sensitivity of drivers to changes in the base fare to score drivers by likelihood of accepting the base fare. However, I don't have driver specific information. Driver data would be key to further developing this analysis, especially considering that how much boosts can be optimized to be claimed earlier depends on the drivers. If I had driver data, I would propose building a model scoring each potential driver based on the characteristics of the trip to see how likely they would be to accept the base fare. Then I would propose segmenting the drivers by the likelihood and, once HSD system decides a boost is needed, I would offer personalized boosts to drivers in small increments starting with the drivers that are more likely to accept the base fare and continuing with the drivers that are less likely to accept the slight boost. Then I would repeat with an additional small boost.\n",
